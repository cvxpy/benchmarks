# CVXPY benchmarks
[![Build Status](http://github.com/cvxpy/benchmarks/workflows/build/badge.svg?event=push)](https://github.com/cvxpy/benchmarks/actions/workflows/build.yml)  
Code and data related to CVXPY benchmarks.

## Motivation
Performance is an important consideration for the development of CVXPY.
The goal of this repo is to collect real-world examples of cvxpy problems and 
to make it easy to generate standardized benchmark reports.

## Getting started
To start benchmarking the CVXPY with Airspeed Velocity, clone this repository on your local system and install the dependencies.
Then run the benchmarks against the latest commit on CVXPY by:
```
asv run
```
Optionally, you can run ``asv dev`` to ensure the code is running smoothly. It is equivalent to the following command:
```
asv run --python=same --quick --show-stderr --dry-run
```
To run a particular benchmark use:
```
asv run --bench CVaRBenchmark
```
You can also collect and view the results on a viewable website:
```
asv run
asv publish
asv preview
```

## Adding a benchmark
To create and test your own benchmark, you need to perform the following steps:
- Create a python file in the folder `benchmark/`.
- Create a class in this file, with the class name being the name of your benchmark. This class has to define 2 functions:
    - `setup()`
    - `time_compile_problem()`
- Add the definition of the CVXPY problem to the `setup()` function of the class.
- The `time_compile_problem()` function should only contain the call to `get_problem_data`.
- Run and test the benchmark inside the local environment on your system. Ideally, the benchmark should take between 5 and 10 seconds.
- Merge and check if it is correctly picked up by `cvxpy/cvxpy` repository and displayed on the dashboard.
